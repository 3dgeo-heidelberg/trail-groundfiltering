## Overview

An important task in the processing of airborne laser scanning data is the derivation of appropriate models (terrain, surface, feature). Setting up such classification and filtering workflows can be time-consuming and prone to information loss, especially in geographically heterogeneous landscapes. AFwizard is an open source Python package designed to improve the productivity of ground point filtering workflows in archaeology and beyond. It provides a Jupyter-based environment for human-in-the-loop, spatially heterogeneous ground point filtering. Through hands-on training, the participants will learn how to study the effects of different algorithm and parameter combinations on digital terrain modelling in a practical and time-saving way. In addition, the AFwizard settings will be tested and analysed using simulated lidar survey scenarios (e.g., airborne, UAV, terrestrial) and point densities. In order to learn how different point cloud properties affect the filtering process, the open source simulator HELIOS++ will be introduced and used together with AFwizard in a hands-on exercise. This will allow for improved filtering of existing data as well as future survey planning.

## What to expect

- Session 1: Introduction to LiDAR ground point filtering using the [AFwizard](https://github.com/ssciwr/afwizard) (Adaptive Filtering Wizard)
- Session 2: Introduction to [HELIOS++](https://github.com/3dgeo-heidelberg/helios) (Heidelberg LiDAR Operations Simulator) and hands-on exercise to find ground point filtering pipelines for different simulated LiDAR scenarios
- Session 3: Application of the learned skills to further datasets (can be your own datasets, provided data or simulated data)
